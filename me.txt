<h1> <b> SAY </b> </h1>
<pre>                 I've been feeling like it's impossible to say it all
                    And I'm losing all control
                   'Cause I wish that I could break the fall and save it all
                    But I've been holding it too close
                    Wish I knew what you're thinking
                    Words don't come that easy
                    We might be broken by design
</pre>

<h2 title=> verse 2 of the song </h2>
<p> I can't help how I'm feeling
Scared of my own reasons
<br>I don't wanna waste your time<br>
Searching for another way
<br>Another way, another way
To keep her safe another day

<br> <p style="font-family:courier;"> i wish my hand writing was this pretty </p>
<br> <p style="font-size:160%;"> i am always moody and i hate it </p>
  <p> <strong> i am important </strong> 
      <br> <i> i think they are all tired of me but i don't blame them </i>
